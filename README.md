<h5 class="text-center"><u><strong><h3>Post-Jam Update patch notes!</u></strong></h3>
<p class="text-center">During the GMTK Game Jam, we had the wonderful experience of crafting this game together and are proud of what we managed to achieve within 48 hours! <br />However, through further playtesting/feedback, it was clear our final product needed some polishing up and there were some features left to add to make the game much better! <br><strong>This post-jam patch&nbsp;</strong><strong>provides a better gameplay experience for the player</strong><strong>, and is the definitive version of our game-jam submission!</strong></p>
<p><strong><ins>Major Changes/Fixes</ins></strong></p>
<ul><li>The game application no longer quits after the player dies. A Death Screen has been added which will allow players to restart from&nbsp;Floor 1 or return to the Main Menu</li><li>The final exit now leads back to the main menu without music overlap</li><li>Players with extra energy will no longer be able to roll die AFTER they roll an extra turn AND during the enemy turn<ul><li>This means if players still have energy (2/3, 1/3) after rolling the extra turn die, they will lose out on that extra energy and automatically skip to their next turn with 3/3</li><li><strong>Ultimately, this makes&nbsp;the combat system to be much more consistent,&nbsp;&nbsp;reducing player confusion and error</strong></li></ul></li></ul>
